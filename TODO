 Hacking on Owyl
=================

An issue tracker and the latest sources can be found at
<http://code.google.com/p/owyl/>. Currently, the project is in need
of the following:

 * Documentation improvements:

   * some example usages in a separate "examples" folder should be the
     next area of focus after basic functionality.

 * Extensions:

   * log -- given a logging function compatible w/ logging module

 * Profiling & optimizing

   * The framework needs to be profiled and examined for bottlenecks,
     especially in the core behaviors.

   * Based on profiling, some of the core behaviors could be rewritten
     in Pyrex to gain some ground.
